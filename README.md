# Building-a-Carbon-Credit-Trading-Platform-on-Celo

This repository contains the code for my tutorial on building a [Carbon Credit Trading Platform on the Celo blockchain](https://celo.academy/t/building-a-carbon-credit-trading-platform-on-celo/2257). The platform leverages the power of Solidity, JavaScript, and the Celo SDK to manage the issuance, trade, and retirement of carbon credits, which are represented by ERC20 tokens. We also demonstrate how to integrate the Toucan Protocol for Tokenized Carbon Credits to digitize the trading process.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have a basic understanding of the following:

- Solidity and JavaScript programming.
- Blockchain concepts, Celo blockchain, and Smart Contracts.
- ERC20 Token Standard.

We recommend you complete the [Getting Started with Celo Development](https://docs.celo.org/) tutorial. Also, the [Developing Smart Contracts on Celo](https://joenyzio.medium.com/6-steps-to-quickly-build-smart-contracts-on-celo-with-remix-a0d1f0a33ef3) tutorial will provide you with an advantage.

## Installation

First, ensure you have Metamask and Node.js installed on your machine. 

1. [Install Metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html)
2. [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) - Ensure you have version 12.0.1 or above.

Then, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourgithubusername/carbon-credit-platform
cd carbon-credit-platform
npm install -g truffle
npm install @celo/contractkit web3 dotenv
```

## Usage

First, compile the smart contract:

```bash
truffle compile
```

Next, migrate the smart contract to the Celo network:

```bash
truffle migrate --network celo
```

You are now ready to interact with the smart contract on the Celo network!
